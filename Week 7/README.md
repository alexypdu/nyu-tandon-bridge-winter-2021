# Week 7

## Agenda

This week we will continue to talk about functions, and start talking about combinatorics. We will introduce basic counting techniques. We will see the sum rule and the product rule which are the basic rules in combinatorics. We will also introduce permutations and combinations.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. You may want to re-watch “Module 8 – Functions” video. And/or re-read pages 181-240, 251-292 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (chapters 4 and 5)
2. Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Counting Basics” in zyBooks
3. Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Permutations and Combinations” in zyBooks
4. Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Additional Topics” in zyBooks
5. Attend the weekly webinar.
6. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to make a call to a function
* Are able to define your own function
* Understand the flow of the control of your program when functions are involved.
* Are familiar with the scoping rules when functions are involved
* Are familiar with the run-time-stack model
* Understand the difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference.
* Are able to design and implement programs using procedural abstraction principles
* Are familiar with the product rule, the sum rule and the bijection rule
* Understand what permutations and R-permutations are counting.
* Are familiar with the values of permutations and r-permutations
* Understand what R-combinations is counting.
* Are familiar with the value of R-combinations
