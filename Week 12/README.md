# Week 12

## Agenda

This week we will be studying object oriented programming including the design of classes, constructors, destructors, copy constructors, operator overloading (including the assignment operator), inheritance and polymorphism.

Object orientation came about in the mid-1980s as a concept to keep data and the functions to work on the data together.  Since then, a lot of development has been done and today object orientation is expected in a lot of situations.  Java, for example, is a purely object-oriented language; everything is an object!

For this week, please do the following:

* Read “Problem solving with C++” by Walter Savitch, chapters 10 and 11
* Be able to answer all of the self-test exercises in the chapters
* Attend the weekly webinar (Thursday 8:00 pm). This week we will be discussing solving problems with pointers and dynamic storage as well as debugging problems with pointers.
* Review the sample code and lecture notes for the CS2124 website listed below. (<http://cis.poly.edu/jsterling/cs2124/>)

## Objectives

By the end of this week, you should:

* Be able to define classes and use them properly
* Understand “encapsulation”
* Understand Public, Private and Protected
* Be able to overload the following operators: +, -, ++, --, \*, \*=, <<, >>, <, =, []
* Understand the Big 3 and when they are needed
* Understand when to implement as a member, non-member friend and non-member non-friend
