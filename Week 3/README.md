# Week 3

## Agenda

This week we will start introducing new statements that allow us to control the flow of our programs. Till now all our programs executed the instructions in a sequential order, line after line. There are more sophisticated ways to have our executions flow. We start by introducing branching statements. These statements allow us to choose which block of instructions will be executed, based on the values of Boolean expressions.

Finally, we will talk about sets, a discrete collection on which many other discrete structures are built. We will also introduce some basic properties of sets, and operations related to sets. We will see how to use these operations to compose more complex structures.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Watch “Module 5, parts 1 and 2 – Branching Statements” videos. Total length is about 70 minutes
2. Read pages 74-83, 120-138 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (sections: 2.4, 3.2)
3. Complete the reading assignment “Week 3: Sets Basics” in zyBooks
4. Complete the reading assignment “Week 3: Sets Operations” in zyBooks
5. Complete the reading assignment “Week 3: Sets Identities” in zyBooks
6. Attend the weekly webinar. If you can't attend in person, there will be a recording of this webinar available later that day
7. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday.

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Understand how Boolean expressions are used to control the flow of programs in a different order than the default sequential flow.
* Are familiar with the syntax of the basic branching statements in C++ (if, if-else, switch).
* Are able to write programs that use data of all types covered, and use branching control.
* Are familiar with the basic sets’ operations
* Can prove properties related to sets
