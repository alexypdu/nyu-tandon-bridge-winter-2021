# Week 8

## Agenda

This week we will learn how to use static arrays, which will be our first data structure in C++. We will see how we can store a collection of elements in one designated entity.

We will learn how to declare such data structures, as well as how to use indices, as a standard naming mechanism, to access the elements and to modify their value.

We will also see the syntax used to work with arrays when defining and calling functions.

We will also talk in more detail about the string type and use its sequential properties and its common methods.

Last topic we start talking this week is probability. Probability theory plays an important role in computer science. In the study of the complexity of algorithms, ideas and techniques from probability theory are used to determine the average-case complexity of algorithms. Probabilistic algorithms can be used to solve many problems that cannot be easily or practically solved by deterministic algorithms. In a probabilistic algorithm, instead of always following the same steps when given the same input, as a deterministic algorithm does, the algorithm makes one or more random choices, which may lead to different output.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Watch “Module 9 – Arrays” video. Introducing static arrays.
2. Read pages 378-387 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (section: 7.1)
3. Watch “Module 10 – Strings” video.
4. Read pages 389-423, 472-487 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (sections: 7.2-7.3, 8.2)
5. Complete the reading assignment “Week 8: Probability Basics” in zyBooks
6. Complete the reading assignment “Week 8: Conditional Probability” in zyBooks
7. Complete the reading assignment “Week 8: Random Variables” in zyBooks
8. Complete the reading assignment “Week 8: Bernoulli Trails” in zebecks
9. Attend the weekly webinar
10. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to declare a static array
* Are able to access elements in an array and modify their values
* Understand how to calculate the physical address in the memory of an element, given only the address where the array starts at, and the index of the element
* Are able to initialize an array with values at declaration line
* Are able to define and call a function with an array as an argument
* Are familiar with the string class, as a sequential data type and its common operators and methods
* Understand that a probability distribution function assigns a probability to each outcome in a sample space
* Know the basic properties of a distribution function
* Able to calculate the probability of events
* Know the properties of the probabilities of the complement event, and of unions of events
* Able to calculate conditional probabilities
* Know how to determine if events are independent
* Are familiar with “Bernoulli trials”, and the “binomial distribution”
* Understand what random variables are, and know how to find the distribution of a random variable
* Know how to determine if random variables are independent
* Understand what is the expected value of a random variable represents, and able to calculate the expected value of a given random variable
* Are familiar with the “linearity of expectations” property
