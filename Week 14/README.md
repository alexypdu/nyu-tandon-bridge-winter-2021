# Week 14

## Agenda

Hopefully everyone is getting caught up with the Object Oriented material and the Doodlebug problem.  Unfortunately, there’s no time to take a break!  We’re moving on but, thankfully, with a bit of an easier topic.  This week, we have two topics at hand, searching and sorting.  The videos are up now and you should begin watching them.  As usual, we will discuss this topic (and I'm sure you'll have doodlebug questions) during our Thursday meeting!

For this week, please do the following:

* Read “Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis” by Mark Allen Weiss, chapters 2 and 7. (Much of chapter 2 is review, concentrate on items you’re not familiar with)
* Be able to answer all of the self-test exercises in the chapters
* Watch “Searching”, and “Sorting” videos.
* Attend the weekly webinar (Thursday 8:00 Pm).

## Objectives

By the end of this week, you should:

* Be familiar with linear search and binary search
* Be familiar with selection sort, bubble sort and merge sort
* Understand the running time analysis of the searching and sorting algorithms covered
