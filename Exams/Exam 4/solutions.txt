6) (10 pts) Short answer:

OS would need to create a new page for the process, and some load control mechanics may be applied to provide the
necessary space if the main memory is already full.

7) (10 pts) Short answer:

Processes in kernel mode could perform direct actions to the hardware, which also put the system under the risk of
failure such as Blue Screen Death. Thus modern Microsoft operating systems impose the restriction on most processes to
guarantee better user experience and system stability.

8) (10 pts) Short answer:

Suppose we have two machines with the same IP addresses in the network, then the router would fail to deliver incoming
packets to either of them as the router could not tell which device is the desired destination when it see the specific
IP address. DHCP servers would spot the duplicates when new devices comes in and asks for an IP address, and then the
servers would reassign IP addresses to those two machines.

9) (10 pts) Short answer:

side A -> router 1 -> router 2 -> ... -> router 10 -> side B
(assume side A and router 1 are really close, similar for side B and router 10)

Total Delay = 2 ms * 10 (processing delay on each router)
            + 9 * (3 * 10^3) / (3 * 10^8) s (sum of distance between every router divided by the light speed)
            = 20 ms + 0.09 ms
            = 20.09 ms

10) (15 pts) Long answer:

Router B would broadcast its distance vector; here the metric is the number of hops.

-----------------------------
| Destination      | Metric |
|----------------------------
| Router A         |   1    |
| Router C         |   1    |

| net: 10.1.1.0/24 |   2    |
| net: 10.2.0.0/24 |   1    |

| net: 10.3.1.0/24 |   2    |

11) (10 pts) Short answer:

Keeping a process on a single CPU may reduce the overhead of moving data in and out the register.

12) (20 pts) Write the code:

bool helper(const vector<int>& v, int low, int high, BSTNode<int>* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return true;
    }

    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    if (v[mid] == root->val) {
        return helper(v, low, mid - 1, root->left) && helper(v, mid + 1, high, root->right);
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

bool treeMatchesVector(const vector<int> v, BSTNode<int>* root) {
    return helper(v, 0, v.size() - 1, root);
}
