> The 100% Online NYU Tandon Bridge Certificate program is an affordable, flexible way for students with a non-technical background to develop the skills necessary for a STEM Master’s degree.

## Program Overview

Whether you are transitioning your career, seeking advancement, or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course will ensure you have the skills necessary to apply for a programming-heavy Master’s Degree. The aim of this course is to prepare students without a technical background to become eligible to apply to one of our select STEM Master’s degree programs.

The NYU Tandon Bridge program is taught by faculty members of the Computer Science department at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, who are accompanied by NYU Tandon Graduate student teaching assistants. The curriculum was designed such that you will gain the knowledge prerequisites for any of our select Master’s programs.

This non-credit certificate course is equivalent to 400 hours of learning and more than three courses containing topics in Computer Programming in C++, Object Oriented Design, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, Principles of Operating Systems, and Introduction to Computer Networks. Students will be required to use the [NYU Tandon Bridge program textbooks](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/nyu-tandon-bridge/preparatory-resources).

Basic proficiency in college algebra and some exposure to C++ is recommended for success in the course. Please see our suggested [Preparatory Resources](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/nyu-tandon-bridge/preparatory-resources) for learning prior to the start of the course.
