# Week 16

## Agenda

This week we will be concentrating on data structures and in doing so, switching books to the Mark Allen Weiss “Data Structures And Algorithm Analysis in C++” book. If you feel you need some more practice with C++ or algorithm analysis, the first two chapters of this book are a good review. For the readings, chapter 3 contains a lot of other information which we’ve already covered, but would be a good review if you need it. I’ll assign sections 3.6, 3.7

For this week:

* View the videos on Stacks and Queues
* Read sections 3.6, 3.7
* Join the Thursday 8:00 Pm webinar, or view it on Thursday after the event.

## Objectives

The data structures we’re discussing this week is Stacks and Queues. Ultimately, we’d like you to be able to understand who these fundamental data types work and are used in Computer Science.

At the end of the week, you should be able to:

* Understand how a stack is designed
* Understand how a queue is designed
* Be able to choose an appropriate data structure for a task.
