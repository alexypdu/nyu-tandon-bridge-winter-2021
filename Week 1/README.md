# Week 1

## Agenda

This week we are going to give you a short introduction of the fundamentals of the computer’s hardware, so we understand the major components inside a computer and their use.

We will then talk about number systems, and see how it is possible to represent the same numbers in different number systems. This will help us understand how data can be represented inside the computer’s memory.

Finally, we will explain the importance of the mathematical language for computer scientists. We will introduce the syntax of propositional logic and then extend it to predicate logic.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Attend our ‘Welcome Webinar’. Join the webinar by going to the "Zoom" tab. If you can't attend in person, there will be a recording of this webinar later that day.
2. Watch “Module 1 - Fundamentals of System Hardware” video
3. Watch “Module 2 – Number Systems” video
4. Access the Discrete Math textbook in zyBooks. You can find instructions and the book code in the syllabus file.
5. Complete the reading assignment “Week 1: Propositional Logic” in zyBooks
6. Complete the reading assignment “Week 1: Predicate Logic” in zyBooks
7. Attend the weekly webinar. If you can't attend in person, there will be a recording of this webinar available later that day
8. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday
9. You may install a C++ IDE – follow the steps described in the installation instructions document (will be posted later this week)

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are familiar with the major hardware components in a computer
* Understand that the same numeric value can be represented in different number systems
* Are familiar with the decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal number systems: know what is the value of a number represented in these systems, and know how to convert a number’s representation from one system to another
* Are familiar with the two’s component representation method: how it is used to represent signed numbers
* Are familiar with the syntax of writing propositions in propositional logic
* Understand the semantics of the basic logical operators (not, and, or and implication)
* Are familiar with the syntax of writing expressions in predicate logic
* Understand the semantics of the universal and existential quantifiers
* Can negate expressions
