# Week 10

## Agenda

This week we will continue using pointers, dynamic arrays, and the Vector data structure.  

You should plan the week as follows:

1. You may want to re-watch “Module 11 – Pointers and Dynamic Storage” video.
2. You may also want to re-read “Problem solving with C++” by Walter Savitch, chapters 8.3 and all of 9 (pages 489-534)
3. Attend the weekly webinar.
4. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the stack
* Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the heap
* Are able to allocate and deallocate memory on the heap
* Understand how to use pointers to access arrays
* Understand how pointer arithmetic works.
* Understand the potential pitfalls of using heap memory
* Use vectors to solve a problem with a dynamic size
