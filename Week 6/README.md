# Week 6

## Agenda

This week we will see how to define our own functions.

We will see how the flow of the execution is jumping when calling a function and then returning, when the execution is over.

We will introduce the run-time-stack as an execution model that manages the scope of variables as well as assists in controlling the flow.
We will also see how we use functions as black boxes and design our program by using procedural abstraction principals.

Another topic we will cover this week is how to measure the performance of our programs. We will see how to make asymptotic analysis of the running time of our programs, and introduce the big-O notation.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Watch “Module 7 – Algorithm Analysis” video.
2. Read pages 181-240, 251-292 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (chapters 4 and 5)
3. Watch “Module 8 – Functions” video. Introducing running time analysis and the big-O notation
4. Read pages 51-70 in the “Data structures and Algorithms in C++” textbook (chapter 2)
5. Attend the weekly webinar.
6. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to make a call to a function
* Are able to define your own function
* Understand the flow of the control of your program when functions are involved.
* Are familiar with the scoping rules when functions are involved
* Are familiar with the run-time-stack model
* Understand the difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference.
* Are able to design and implement programs using procedural abstraction principles
* Are familiar with the mathematical definition of big-O
* Are able to analyze the asymptotic running time of programs you implement
