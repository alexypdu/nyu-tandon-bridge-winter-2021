# Week 11

## Agenda

This week we will talk about a new and powerful problem solving technique – recursions. We will start by reviewing mathematical induction and an extended form of it (called strong induction). We will see that there is a close relation between mathematical induction, as a proving technique, and recursion, as a problem solving technique. We will then go over the steps we need to take when developing a recursive algorithm.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Watch “Recursions – Part 1”, “Recursions – Part 2” and “Recursions – Part 3” videos. Introducing the concept of recursion.
2. Read related topics of chapter "7. Induction and Recursion" in zyBooks
3. Read pages 789-822 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (part of chapter 14)
4. Read pages 6-12 in the “Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis in C++” textbook (sections 1.2.5 and 1.3)
5. Attend the weekly webinar
6. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday
7. **Study for the exam!**

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to prove statements using mathematical induction technique (regular form and strong induction)
* Are able solve computational problems using recursions
* See the similarities between induction and recursion
