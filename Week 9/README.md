# Week 9

## Agenda

This week we are studying pointers and dynamic arrays and we introduce our first STL data structure, the Vector!  

Pointers are incredibly powerful in C++, but can also bring to light potentially catastrophic problems with your code.  If you find that your code compiles but crashes when you run it, this is a classic sign of a pointer error.

Visual Studio and CLion have some wonderful features built in known as “Debuggers” which allow you to step through the code and see what is happening at each individual line.  You can set watches, view local variables’ values and use the autos window to see what’s going wrong with the code.  Plan to use the debugger as it is a wonderful resource.

In the Math portion of this week, we will continue to look at random variables and expected value.

You should plan the week as follows:

1. Watch “Module 11 – Pointers and Dynamic Storage” video.
2. Read “Problem solving with C++” by Walter Savitch, chapters 8.3 and all of 9 (pages 489-534)
3. Attend the weekly webinar.
4. Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday

## Objectives

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

* Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the stack
* Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the heap
* Are able to allocate and deallocate memory on the heap
* Understand how to use pointers to access arrays
* Understand how pointer arithmetic works.
* Understand the potential pitfalls of using heap memory
* Use vectors to solve a problem with a dynamic size
